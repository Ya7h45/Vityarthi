The Python script, named weather_app.py, is a desktop weather application built using the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface (GUI). The application's core function is to retrieve current weather data for a specified city by interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library. It utilizes a custom "Pink Sky" color palette, incorporating colors like #fff0f5 (Lavender Blush) for the background and #e91e63 (Deep Pink) for temperature displays, giving it a distinctive aesthetic. The logic is encapsulated in two main functions: get_weather(city), which constructs the API request, handles network and data errors (such as a 404 "City not found" response), and extracts key weather metrics like temperature, humidity, and wind speed; and search_weather(), which retrieves the user input, calls the fetching function, and updates the Tkinter labels with the formatted results. Notably, the script converts the Unix timestamps for sunrise and sunset into a readable HH:MM AM/PM format and provides comprehensive error handling through tkinter.messagebox pop-ups for issues like timeouts, configuration errors (missing API key), and bad requests.
