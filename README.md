A simple, graphical weather application built with **Tkinter** in Python that fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

It features a light-hearted "Pink Sky" color palette for a unique and visually pleasing user interface.



* **Real-time Weather:** Fetches current temperature, "feels like" temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
* **Location Display:** Shows the city and country for the queried location.
* **Sunrise/Sunset Times:** Displays formatted sunrise and sunset times.
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling for API failures, network issues, and city-not-found scenarios.
* **Pink Sky Theme:** Uses a custom, light-pink/rose color palette for a gentle aesthetic.



Before running the application, you need to have **Python 3** installed, along with the following libraries:

1.  **`tkinter`**: Usually included with standard Python installations.
2.  **`requests`**: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.

You can install the `requests` library using pip:

```bash
pip install requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # <--- REPLACE THIS
